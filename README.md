05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler



When the planner is opened the current date and time is displayed at the top of the page.
The current time and date is updated by the second.
When you scroll down you are presented with time blocks for each hours of the working day.
Time blocks are colour coded to show if each hour is past, present or future. Colours will update automatically as the day goes on.
A user can click on a time block and add text. When text is added a save button will display and the user can save their entry.
Entries are saved to local storage and persist when the page is closed or refreshed.
